# Website-Scraping-

In this project I have used python to scrap website. I have taken Internshala website and scraped it extracting name of internship, company, location, start date, stipend, duration and deadline of different Computer Science Internships offered at Internshala.

I have used Urllib and BeautifulSoup libraries to open and parse the website respectively. I have saved the data extracted in a .csv file.
